# Regression_Analysis in R Programming 

📊 Exploring Data and Conducting Regression Analysis in R 📈

Hey GitHub community! 👋🏼 Excited to share a step-by-step regression analysis I performed using R on the classic mtcars dataset. 🚗💨 Let's dive into the details:

🔍 Exploring the Data:
I started by loading the dataset and taking a quick look. With dimensions and correlation matrix in hand, I gained insights into the relationships among variables. 

📊 Fitting Regression Models:
Next up, I fitted multiple linear regression models to predict MPG based on various car attributes. I refined the models by including specific variables, comparing their summaries and analysis of variance. 

📈 Assumptions and Diagnostics:
Checking assumptions is crucial! I calculated residuals, assessed multicollinearity with VIF, tested for autocorrelation using Durbin-Watson, and examined heteroscedasticity via the Breusch-Pagan test. A comprehensive approach to ensure robust conclusions. #DataDiagnostics

🧪 Studying Residuals and Normality:
I delved into residual analysis to validate model assumptions. The Shapiro-Wilk test for normality and a set of diagnostic plots provided insights into the residuals' distribution and goodness-of-fit. #ResidualAnalysis
